# mac-lookup
Web page that displays info of the device that has the provided MAC address.

The information is stored in a Google SpreadSheet containing the following columns:
* Name
* Device Make and model
* MAC address
* LAN IP
* Notes

If you want to use your own Google SpreadSheet with your data you must change the `spreadsheetId` variable value to your own id in the index.html file.
